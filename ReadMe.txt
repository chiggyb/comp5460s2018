The code for Question 1 has been written in python using the turtle graphics which works in a similar fashion to JavaScripts canvas and is hosted in my profile on repl.it which is an online python decoder.

The code for question 2 is written in Javascript using the canvas module.
In order to do a little extra for the extra grades and a good impression I have implemented a fractal code to design a tree using the turtle.
