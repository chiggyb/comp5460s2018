Final Project Week 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. 3D_chirag file contains the html which uses WebGL to show the 3D rendering created using only 2D coordinates, i.e only x and y coordinates 
2. WebGL provides us with various functions to draw and stylize various objects. I have tried to use most of these so I can finally make my final project as desired.
3. In order to perform these renderings I have tried to rotate the drawing to fully demonstrate the 3D effect. 
4. I am using Three.js as the javascript library of WebGL to perform these animations.
5. This week my work made me learn about rendering 3D using only 2D coordinates and how camera and lights work. You can read more about it in the report.
